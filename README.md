# Betta-Wire-V1.0
Betta-Wire V1.0 is an affordable, open-source wire EDM machine designed for enthusiats. It allows users to cut electrically conductive materials such as steel and aluminum without the need for expensive industrial equipment like fiber lasers or CNC machines.

## Features 

- **Open Source**: Fully open-source design, allowing for community contributions and custom modifications.
- **User-3D-Printed**: Most components can be 3D printed, making it accessible and customizable.
- **Powercore Compatible**: Compatible with Powercore V2.0 EDM power supply.
- **4-Axis Motion**: Top and bottom EDM tools are capable of indepedent motion for X, Y, U, & V motion. 
- **Compact Build Area**: 100mm x 200mm, suitable for moderate-scale projects.
- **Material Compatibility**: Capable of cutting aluminum, steel, titanium, and other electrically conductive materials.

## Revisions 

### RevA

RevA is the prototype proof-of-concept version of the Betta-Wire V1.0. It served as the initial platform to test and validate the core functionality of the machine. While functional, it lacks some of the refinements and optimizations planned for the final kit version.

### RevB

RevB is the branch for the final version that will be used for the kit. This version includes all the improvements and optimizations based on the learnings from RevA. It is intended for distribution to users who will assemble the Betta-Wire V1.0 from the kit.

## Recommended Prerequisites

- 3D Printer (capable of printing carbon fiber PLA)
- Basic understanding of mechatronics and 3D printing
